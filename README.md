## Overview of analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to use Tableau to create effective visualizations from Citi Bike data in New York City. This analysis will be used to impress potential investors for a bike sharing business in Des Moines similar to Citi Bike in NYC.


#### Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format
#### Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
* Visualizations 1-2: Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
* Visualizations 3-4: Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
* Visualization 5: Shows the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
#### Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation


## Results
Results: Using the visualizations you have in your Tableau Story, describe the results of each visualization underneath the image


## Summary
Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.

In Tableau, create a new Story using visualizations that will support the key findings you want to show.

You must use the five visualizations that you created in Deliverable 2.
You must use at least two visualizations that you created in this module.
